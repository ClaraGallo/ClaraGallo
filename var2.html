<p> You can only work for people that you like. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is a curious rule. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; and it took me a long time to learn because in fact at the beginning of my practice I felt the opposite.
<br>
<br> 
<br>
<br>
<br>
Professionalism required that you didn't '  particularly like the people that you worked for or at least maintained an arms length relationship to them, which meant that I never had lunch with a client or saw them socially. 
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Then some years ago I realised that the opposite was true. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I discovered that all the work I had done that was meaningful and significant came out of an affectionate relationship with a client. 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br> 
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
And I am not talking about professionalism; I am talking about affection. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  I am talking about a client and you sharing some common ground. That in fact your view of life is someway congruent with the client, otherwise it is a 
<br>
<br>
bitter, 
<br> 
<br>
and hopeless, 
<br>
<br> 
<br> 
struggle.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a href="var3.html">2</a>
