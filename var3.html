One night I was sitting in my car outside Columbia University where my wife Shirley was studying Anthropology. 
While I was waiting I was listening to the radio and heard an interviewer ask "Now that you have reached 75 have you any advice for our audience about how to prepare for your old age?" 
An irritated voice said "Why is everyone asking me about old age these days?" I recognised the voice as John Cage. I am sure that many of you know who he was the composer and philosopher who influenced people like Jasper Johns and Merce Cunningham as well as the music world in general. I knew him slightly and admired his contribution to our times. 
"You know, I do know how to prepare for old age he said. "Never have a job, because if you have a job someday someone will take it away from you and then you will be unprepared for your old age. For me, it has always been the same every since the age of 12. 
I wake up in the morning and I try to figure out how am I going to put bread on the table today? It is the same at 75, I wake up every morning and I think how am I going to put bread on the table today? I am exceedingly well prepared for my old age" he said.
